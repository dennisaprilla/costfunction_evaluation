- This simulation is meant to search the optimal hyper-parameters for GMML2 distance costfunction (scale_a, scale_b, and alpha).
- The we look for a very coarse way first, i.e., the scale is 1e-3:1e-3:5e-3 and alpha is from 0.5:0.5:2.0
- b-mode mesurement is using usdata_b_0a
- a-mode measurement is using accessible_sim2/amode_tibia_15
